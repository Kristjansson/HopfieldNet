\begin{abstract}
Hopfield Neural Networks are a simple model of biological cognitive processes. In this paper we introduce how the Hopfield Neural Network operates. We analyze the dynamics to show how information that is learned is stored in the stable points; we demonstrate how to build one from simply matrix products; and, we test our resulting model on the famous MNIST dataset.
